# Building modern websites.

This is a project made by Lucas Christian, with the aim
to create extremely simple templates for modern websites, and
in the most professional way possible, with everything ready to go
develop, build, and launch your website!

## How can I collaborate?

Whenever you think of an even better way to make it all more
simple, and even more professional any of the templates, can
always make a pull request! I count on everyone's help to keep
everything always updated, let's make sure everyone can always start
your sites having a good foundation.

## Want to share your template?

If you want to share your template, in any language
you can send me an email with your discord, and I will add you there
you can send me and preferably already with a README of your template, but
in case you haven't done a README, can you explain how it works and together
we can write one!

## Identified an error in any of the templates?

If you have identified an error, just open an issues, and if you have
resolved this error, please make a pull request, and join as a contributor!
